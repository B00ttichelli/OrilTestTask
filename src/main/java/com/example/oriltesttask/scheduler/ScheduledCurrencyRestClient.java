  /*  You need to create a cron job timer that runs every 10 seconds and pulls cryptocurrency last prices from CEX.IO.
   Hint: use endpoint that returns last price of selected pair. For this task you should pull last prices for the following pairs: BTC/USD, ETH/USD and XRP/USD.
   This data should be stored in database, since you will use this data in the next two parts of the task.
   Feel free to store any additional information to database like ‘createdAt’ date etc.



   Example
   Get https://cex.io/api/last_price/BTC/USD

   Response
      {
         " lprice": "62313.7",
          "curr1": "BTC",
          "curr2": "USD"
      }
